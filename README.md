# fekoneko-theme for VSCode

My personal theme for VSCode. It's still work in progress.

I tweaked it specifically to match `libadwaita` theme on my system (_Graphite_ theme on Linux Mint with the dark variant). I also removed some bloat from VSCode interface from the settings, so it looks something like this:

# If you also want to use this theme

- Just run and say yes for all prompts:
```shell
bun install
bun run build
```
- Install the extension from the `./fekoneko-theme-<version>.vsix` file
- You also can run the extension in devmode with hot reloading and stuff from _Debug_ menu in VSCode
