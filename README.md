# fekoneko-theme for VSCode

My personal theme for VSCode. Super minimalistic and super flat.

I also recommend removing some bloat from VSCode interface from the settings,
so it looks something like this:

# If you also want to use this theme

- Just run and say yes for all prompts:

```shell
bun install
bun run build
```

- Install the extension from the `./fekoneko-theme-<version>.vsix` file
- You also can run the extension in devmode with hot reloading and stuff from _Debug_ menu in VSCode
